# Third-party Libraries

This directory contains header-only C++ libraries used by the plugin.

## Included
*   `httplib.h` - [cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) (Copied from flora-uxp)

## Missing (User Action Required)
*   `json.hpp` - [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
    *   Please download `json.hpp` (single header) and place it here.
    *   The `flora-uxp` project did not appear to use this library (it used regex parsing), so we cannot copy it automatically.
